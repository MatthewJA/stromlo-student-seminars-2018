Have you ever, ever felt like you want to present your work to like-minded students?

The Australian National University Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics is pleased to present the 2018 Mount Stromlo Student Seminars! This two-day conference is designed to be a fun and relaxed event for astronomy and astrophysics research students from all over Australia. The event will give you the chance to network with your peers (and future colleagues), practise your public speaking skills, and learn about a variety of topics.

Your talk doesn't have to be on astronomy! [Past talks](http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/xmas17/program/) have been about everything from planet formation and magnetic fields, to Fourier transforms, Monte Carlo Markov chains, and even dating sims!

This year's theme is **children's television**. A prize will be awarded for the talk that best fits the theme!

## Logistics

The seminars will be held on the 29th&ndash;30th of November at Mount Stromlo Observatory in Canberra, Australia. The event is fully catered. Lunch and refreshments will be provided on both days, and there will be a conference dinner on the 29th of November.

Students will have opportunity to present talks on both days of the conference.

## Information for presenters

The time limit for talks is 12 minutes, with 3 minutes for questions and changeover. You are encouraged to share your exciting research, something funny, or something you find relevant to the theme. Better yet, you can incorporate the theme into your science talk. There will be prizes for the best science talk, the best theme-related talk and the best overall talk.
