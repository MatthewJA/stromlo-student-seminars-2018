## Accommodation in Canberra

We suggest that you book a room at a hotel in Civic or Acton, so we can most easily arrange your transportation to Mount Stromlo. Two options are given below.

- University House, located in the ANU main campus
- Canberra City YHA, located close to the city centre

## Transport to and from Canberra

**From Sydney**, Murrays operate an express bus from Sydney to Jolimont Centre in Civic. It is a short walk to the centre of Canberra, and ANU campus is a 20 minute walk away. Virgin and Qantas both fly to Canberra airport. Bus and taxi services operate between the airport and the centre of town. The train from Sydney stops in Kingston, which is a 15 minute drive from the centre of town. Travelling to Canberra by car takes ~3-4 hours on the Federal Highway.

**From everywhere else:** Virgin and Qantas both fly to Canberra airport. We are able to offer limited travel support. To apply for travel support please fill out the relevant section in the registration form before October 15.

## Transport to Mount Stromlo

There is no public transport to or from Mount Stromlo Observatory. For those without a car, you can make your way to and from Mount Stromlo via the shuttle bus which stops at 6 Hutton Street at 8:20 am and departs Stromlo at 5:00 pm. Please contact us if you are not staying near the campus and do not have a car so that we can organise a lift with students or staff.
