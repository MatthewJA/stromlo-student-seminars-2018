            <p class="abstract">The protostellar cloud and disc environment at the early stages of star formation have important implications for the formation of planets at a later stage. Here I will discuss the initial results of my simulations of the formation of a protostellar disc and its associated chemical and physical evolution to investigate the implications this has for the earliest stages of planet formation. Meteoritic evidence (such as high temperature inclusions) suggests certain temperature and density processing histories throughout the Sun's protostellar disc, however such environments are not typically found in observations or simulations of other discs. Given that if you can’t go under, over, or around something the best way is through it, I follow tracer particles through the various environments of the protostellar disc.</p>

            <h3>How I explained 'Cultural Competence for Astronomers' to my 9-year old son</h3>
            <span class="presenter">Carla B. Guedes</span>
            <span class="institution">The University of New South Wales</span>
            <time>16:00 &ndash; 16:15</time>
            <p class="abstract">This presentation focuses on how I explained complex concepts such as cultural competence, astronomy, Indigenous knowledge, and the implications thereof for ethnographic theory and practice to my 9-year old son, Lourenço. The aim of my research is to present a systematic approach to gaining cultural competence for astronomers who wish to work with Indigenous people or develop research facilities on Indigenous lands. This Master by Research thesis will propose a new cultural competence model – MICCA (Model of Indigenous Cultural Competence for Astronomers) and a new theoretical diagram - the Astronomy Cultural Competence Continuum. I will argue that these two new theoretical proposals can help astronomers before, during and after either ethnographic research, the implementation of telescopes facilities projects, and designing protocols between astronomers and indigenous for various projects. Is it possible to significantly increase the Astronomer’s Cultural Competency, protecting Indigenous peoples culture and interests while improving the astronomers’ scientific research? To answer this research question, I will present two case studies: a) The possible lack of Cultural Competency observed in the case of Hawai’i’s sacred mountain and the contentious Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). The dormant volcano is Hawai’i’s most sacred place, where in ancient traditions only the Ali’i (high chiefs) were allowed to climb to its summit where their most sacred ancestors are buried. And this is where astronomers are trying to build research facilities; b) The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project, in South Africa and Australia, where astronomers gained a deeper understanding of a different perspective of the sky from working closely with the Indigenous, opening up new areas of opportunity, education and vocation for these communities. This project seemed to be culturally competent and resulted in a peaceful process regarding Indigenous feedback and acceptance. To test the hypothesis, both case studies were analyzed through the Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) as the chosen Qualitative research method. The primary research findings will be presented and discussed in this presentation, and critical recommendations to accomplish a cultural competent first encounter with Indigenous peoples will be explored. My research is not an easy topic for my kid, however I will share how I explained him the “big idea”, and I will show how he understood it, and why he is now so interested in the topic.</p>

            <span class="institution">The Australian National University</span>
            <time>16:15 &ndash; 16:30</time>
            <p class="abstract">Most exoplanets have been discovered by the transit and radial velocity methods but these are limited to planets at small separations.  It is generally believed giant planets like Jupiter formed further out so their formation is best observed through the challenging method of direct imaging.  I discuss how these planets could form by core accretion and how, during this period, they should be bright enough to detect with current instruments.</p>

            <p class="abstract">Attending conferences can be the highlight of the academic year (free food? yay!) but can also be sources of anxiety for many students and academics. In this talk, I'll share some of the things I've learned during my time as a PhD student for the before, during and after of attending conferences, as well as some tips and hints on how to get yourself that all-important conference invite. This talk will be based on my popular (and now highly plagiarized) blog post: Ten tips for students attending conferences.</p>

            <h3>Generalized Viscous Disk Model for Accretion Disks Around T Tauri Stars</h3>
            <span class="presenter">Piyush Sharda</span>
            <span class="institution">The Australian National University</span>
            <time>09:45 &ndash; 10:00</time>
            <p class="abstract">The observed spreads in mass accretion rates and disk masses of pre-main sequence T Tauri stars is more than 5 orders of magnitude. It is important to understand the nature and cause of this spread to study the subsequent evolution of stars and planets. In this talk, I will show that the Classical Model of accretion disks based on the radial viscosity formulation cannot explain the observed trends of accretion rate with time, as is already known. I will introduce our Generalized Model which contains a radial as well as temporal dependence on viscosity and show that an analytic solution still exists, which we have successfully used to simultaneously fit the observed trends and distributions of accretion rates and disk masses with time. Further, by introducing a cutoff accretion rate based on stellar mass and luminosity, we evolved the Generalized model to also fit the observed trends of disk fractions. I will discuss the parameters of interest which can be tweaked to obtain suitable fits for explaining the trends and distributions of accretion rates, disk masses and disk fractions. This model has practical applications for the evolution of stellar structure and dynamics and can be used to study planet formation, disk dispersal processes, rotation and spin evolution of stars, episodic accretion, etc.</p>

                The brightest galaxies of groups and clusters are extremely luminous galaxies, usually located in the centres of those systems – central galaxies. In the hierarchical scenario of structure formation, galaxies grow in mass and size by merging with their neighbours. Simulations predict that central galaxies have higher merger rates than other similarly luminous early type galaxies, mostly due to their privileged position at the bottom of the gravitational potential of the cluster.
 
                The recent accretion history of galaxies can be read through their stellar population gradients. Therefore, central galaxies with active merger histories are predicted to have shallower metallicity gradients than satellite galaxies of a similar mass.
                 
                We are examining the stellar population gradients (age and metallicity) of 445 central galaxies in the SAMI galaxy survey to determine whether they are offset from similarly massive satellite galaxies in order to reach a better understanding of their formation and evolution history.

            <p class="abstract">Deriving elemental abundances from stellar spectroscopy is a challenging yet important task applicable to many scientific interests, including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, stellar evolution, Galaxy chemical evolution and origin of the elements. This derivation requires modelling of the stellar atmospheres and spectral line formation to predict the emergent spectrum and matching it to the observed spectrum. The inferred abundances are thus model dependent, making it crucial to employ the most realistic models. Recently it has become possible to replace standard 1D LTE modelling with 3D NLTE which however are computationally very expensive; with each model taking thousands of CPU hours. We have computed the 3D NLTE synthetic spectra of lithium using ∼200 3D stellar atmosphere models (applicable to any solar type star), and their counterparts in 1D for comparison. Additionally, we provide an interpolation routine which can be used to predict lithium abundances and line profiles over different stellar parameters.</p>

            <p class="abstract">A gamma-ray excess peaking at 2 GeV originating from the Galactic Center has been observed. Is it due to a population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the Galactic Bulge, which are intensely luminous in gamma-rays, like Death Stars arming with destructive death-rays in Star Wars? Fitting the observational period and magnetic field distributions of present-day MSPs, the luminosity distribution of a population of MSPs is investigated.</p>

            <p class="abstract">Galaxy clusters are the largest virialized objects in the Universe, and are powerful probes of cosmology. Their abundance as a function of mass and redshift is extremely sensitive to how structures grow and the properties of dark energy. Though they are powerful probes of cosmology, they are currently limited by mass uncertainty which is ~ 15%. In this talk I will introduce methods to measure galaxy cluster mass using CMB lensing. CMB-cluster lensing offers a robust and accurate way to constrain galaxy cluster masses, especially at high redshift (z > 1) where optical lensing measurements are challenging. With CMB lensing we expect to improve mass uncertainty to 3% for upcoming experiments such as AdVACT, SPT-3G etc., and to 1% for next generation CMB experiments. In this talk, I will report on a demonstration of this technique using CMB data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) to constrain masses of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) galaxy cluster catalog.</p>
