            <h3>Determining effects of telescope spatial resolution with synthetic observations of galaxy simulations</h3>
            <span class="presenter">Ayan Acharyya</span>
            <span class="institution">The Australian National University</span>
            <time>09:30 &ndash; 9:45</time>
            <p class="abstract">How well can we recover metallicity gradient in galaxies, given telescope limitations? We produce realistic synthetic IFU
data cubes from Enzo simulations of star forming disk galaxies, by including the effects of telescope resolution and
instrumental noise, to understand the observation of metallicity gradients. We conduct a parameter study to specifically
investigate the effect of spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on inferred metallicity gradient. I will present our
new MAPPINGS photoionization models of HII regions and the steps involved to produce the mock data cubes. I will also
discuss the results and their implications on the metallicity gradient measurements currently being carried out as part of
large IFU surveys like SAMI. We find that, at a given spatial resolution the accuracy of the inferred gradient saturates to a
“best possible” value, irrespective of how high the SNR is. The magnitude of this accuracy depends on the true gradient
and the metallicity diagnostic used. I will also discuss the effects of imposing a SNR threshold criteria. In future, we plan
to use other hydrodynamical simulations with different underlying physics, to generate our mock observations.
Comparing the different mock observations with real IFU observations will help us constrain the physical processes in the
observed galaxies.</p>

            <h3>Observing Exoplanets with a Ground-Based Telescope and Orbiting Starshade</h3>
            <span class="presenter">Dr John C. Mather</span>
            <span class="institution">NASA</span>
            <time>11:00 &ndash; 12:00</time>
            <p class="abstract">An orbiting starshade could work with adaptive optics on a ground-based telescope to enable imaging and spectroscopic observation of Earth-like planets and planetary systems around Sun-like stars.  With 30 m class telescopes in both hemispheres, the entire sky is observable with exposure times of hours for 10 σ imaging per Earth-like target system at 10 pc distance. With ~ 70 sun-like stars (F, G, and K classes) within 10 pc, we could survey hundreds of planets with multicolor imaging to learn how many might resemble Earth and determine their orbits. Low resolution spectroscopy is also achievable. The higher angular resolution of the starshade - ground telescope combination can enable science that is not accessible with smaller space telescopes, and could potentially be implemented much sooner.<br>

            <h3>ICM Turbulence and AGN jets through Tom and Jerry</h3>
            <span class="presenter">Rajsekhar Mohapatra</span>
            <span class="institution">The Australian National University</span>
            <time>13:00 &ndash; 13:15</time>
            <p class="abstract">The AGN feedback model is an attractive solution to the cooling flow problem in the intracluster medium. While this is a messy system with lots of complicated physics, things become considerably simpler when we replace AGN jets with Jerry, and turbulence with Tom. The feedback loop self imposes, and the physics becomes much simpler (just like in our simulations, as if there is any physics in it), making it an accurate representation. 
            We can also discuss future prospects, like adding gravity, only now that I looked down at my work.</p>

            <h3>Rapid Black Hole Growth at the Dawn of the Universe: A Super-Eddington Quasar at z=6.6</h3>
            <span class="presenter">Ji-Jia Tang</span>
            <span class="institution">The Australian National University</span>
            <time>14:00 &ndash; 14:15</time>
            <p class="abstract">We present the analysis of a new near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of a recently discovered z = 6.621 quasar PSO J006+39 in an attempt to explore the early growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). This NIR (rest-frame ultraviolet, UV) spectrum shows blue continuum slope and rich metal emission lines in addition to Lyα line. We utilize the Mg ii line width and the rest frame luminosity L3000Å to find the mass of SMBH (MBH) to be ∼ 108M⊙, making this one of the lowest mass quasars at high redshift. The power-law slope index (αλ) of the continuum emission is −2.94 ± 0.03, significantly bluer than the slope of αλ = −7/3 predicted from standard thin disc models. We fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) using a model which can fit local SMBHs, which includes warm and hot Comptonisation powered by the accretion flow as well as an outer standard disc. The result shows that the very blue slope is probably produced by a small radial (∼ 230 gravitational radius, Rg) extent of the standard accretion disc. All plausible SED models require that the source is super-Eddington (Lbol/LEdd 􏰀 9), so the apparently small disc may simply be the inner funnel of a puffed up flow, and clearly the SMBH in this quasar is in a rapid growth phase. We also utilize the rest-frame UV emission lines to probe the chemical abundance in the broad line region (BLR) of this quasar. We find that this quasar has super solar metallicity through photoionization model calculations.</p>

            <p class="abstract">The protostellar cloud and disc environment at the early stages of star formation have important implications for the formation of planets at a later stage. Here I will discuss the initial results of my simulations of the formation of a protostellar disc and its associated chemical and physical evolution to investigate the implications this has for the earliest stages of planet formation. Meteoritic evidence (such as high temperature inclusions) suggests certain temperature and density processing histories throughout the Sun's protostellar disc, however such environments are not typically found in observations or simulations of other discs. Given that if you can’t go under, over, or around something the best way is through it, I follow tracer particles through the various environments of the protostellar disc.</p>

            <h3>How I explained 'Cultural Competence for Astronomers' to my 9-year old son</h3>
            <span class="presenter">Carla B. Guedes</span>
            <span class="institution">The University of New South Wales</span>
            <time>16:00 &ndash; 16:15</time>
            <p class="abstract">This presentation focuses on how I explained complex concepts such as cultural competence, astronomy, Indigenous knowledge, and the implications thereof for ethnographic theory and practice to my 9-year old son, Lourenço. The aim of my research is to present a systematic approach to gaining cultural competence for astronomers who wish to work with Indigenous people or develop research facilities on Indigenous lands. This Master by Research thesis will propose a new cultural competence model – MICCA (Model of Indigenous Cultural Competence for Astronomers) and a new theoretical diagram - the Astronomy Cultural Competence Continuum. I will argue that these two new theoretical proposals can help astronomers before, during and after either ethnographic research, the implementation of telescopes facilities projects, and designing protocols between astronomers and indigenous for various projects. Is it possible to significantly increase the Astronomer’s Cultural Competency, protecting Indigenous peoples culture and interests while improving the astronomers’ scientific research? To answer this research question, I will present two case studies: a) The possible lack of Cultural Competency observed in the case of Hawai’i’s sacred mountain and the contentious Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). The dormant volcano is Hawai’i’s most sacred place, where in ancient traditions only the Ali’i (high chiefs) were allowed to climb to its summit where their most sacred ancestors are buried. And this is where astronomers are trying to build research facilities; b) The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project, in South Africa and Australia, where astronomers gained a deeper understanding of a different perspective of the sky from working closely with the Indigenous, opening up new areas of opportunity, education and vocation for these communities. This project seemed to be culturally competent and resulted in a peaceful process regarding Indigenous feedback and acceptance. To test the hypothesis, both case studies were analyzed through the Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) as the chosen Qualitative research method. The primary research findings will be presented and discussed in this presentation, and critical recommendations to accomplish a cultural competent first encounter with Indigenous peoples will be explored. My research is not an easy topic for my kid, however I will share how I explained him the “big idea”, and I will show how he understood it, and why he is now so interested in the topic.</p>

            <span class="presenter">Piyush Sharda</span>
            <span class="institution">The Australian National University</span>
            <time>09:45 &ndash; 10:00</time>
            <p class="abstract">The observed spreads in mass accretion rates and disk masses of pre-main sequence T Tauri stars is more than 5 orders of magnitude. It is important to understand the nature and cause of this spread to study the subsequent evolution of stars and planets. In this talk, I will show that the Classical Model of accretion disks based on the radial viscosity formulation cannot explain the observed trends of accretion rate with time, as is already known. I will introduce our Generalized Model which contains a radial as well as temporal dependence on viscosity and show that an analytic solution still exists, which we have successfully used to simultaneously fit the observed trends and distributions of accretion rates and disk masses with time. Further, by introducing a cutoff accretion rate based on stellar mass and luminosity, we evolved the Generalized model to also fit the observed trends of disk fractions. I will discuss the parameters of interest which can be tweaked to obtain suitable fits for explaining the trends and distributions of accretion rates, disk masses and disk fractions. This model has practical applications for the evolution of stellar structure and dynamics and can be used to study planet formation, disk dispersal processes, rotation and spin evolution of stars, episodic accretion, etc.</p>

            <time>10:15 &ndash; 10:30</time>
            <p class="abstract">Current thought is that the Milky Way (MW) formed hierarchically, through minor mergers and the accretion of smaller objects like dwarf satellites and star clusters. As a means of probing this formation history, searches have been made for the stellar populations and tidal debris of these systems in an effort to identify and characterize their extragalactic progenitors. However, in the case of ancient mergers or mergers with low mass progenitors, the stellar population is expected to be completely dispersed within the MW. The MW outer halo is a potential hunting ground for these dispersed stellar populations. Using high resolution spectroscopic data from Gemini’s GRACES instrument combined with Gaia proper motions, we construct complete chemodynamic histories for a handful of potentially captured MW outer halo stars. I will present  the initial results of the chemodynamic study, including orbital integrations of 20 Gyr and chemical abundances for 20+ elements. 

In the frigid north entertainment comes in many forms, sledding down slopes onto frozen lakes under The Northern Lights, avoiding being tricked into eating the yellow snow or cozying up to watch your favourite publicly funded Canadian T.V. show. In this talk I will present the results of growing up above the 64th parallel, focusing primarily on Canadian children’s television. Featuring; a talking French pineapple, the world’s first fully CGI-animated T.V. show, live action guinea pigs in hot air balloons and Yvon of the Yukon.</p>

            <h3>A turbulence-regulated star formation law</h3>
            <span class="presenter">Diane Salim</span>
            <span class="institution">The Australian National University</span>
            <time>11:30 &ndash; 11:45</time>
            <p class="abstract">We present a new universal star formation law based on the probability density function (PDF) and sonic Mach number of the turbulence in star-forming clouds. In our relation the star formation rate (SFR) correlates with the molecular gas mass per multi-freefall time. We show that the actual SFR is only about 0.45% of the maximum possible SFR, confirming the observed low efficiency of star formation. We show that placing observations in the framework of our developed relation yields a significantly improved correlation with 3-4 times reduced scatter compared to previous star formation relations, such as the Kennicutt-Schmidt or the Krumholz-Dekel-McKee relation. We use this new relation to develop a new method for estimating the column density of cold molecular gas (Σgas) using integral field spectroscopy. We utilise the spatially resolved Hα maps of flux and velocity dispersion from the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral-field spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey to make our estimates. Finally, we present and utilise data from the Combined Array from Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) and the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) Telescope to measure the star formation efficiency across the face-on Hickson Compact Group galaxy NCG7674. We find that this galaxy is extremely inefficient and cannot be described by star formation relations developed in previous literature. We therefore extend our multi-freefall star formation relation to take into account the virial parameter of the turbulent clouds, which yields significantly improved predictions of the SFR compared to any previous star formation law.</p>

                The brightest galaxies of groups and clusters are extremely luminous galaxies, usually located in the centres of those systems – central galaxies. In the hierarchical scenario of structure formation, galaxies grow in mass and size by merging with their neighbours. Simulations predict that central galaxies have higher merger rates than other similarly luminous early type galaxies, mostly due to their privileged position at the bottom of the gravitational potential of the cluster.<br>
 
                The recent accretion history of galaxies can be read through their stellar population gradients. Therefore, central galaxies with active merger histories are predicted to have shallower metallicity gradients than satellite galaxies of a similar mass.<br>
                 
                We are examining the stellar population gradients (age and metallicity) of 445 central galaxies in the SAMI galaxy survey to determine whether they are offset from similarly massive satellite galaxies in order to reach a better understanding of their formation and evolution history.

            <h3>3D NLTE Spectral Line Formation of Lithium in Late-type Stars</h3>
            <span class="presenter">Ella Wang</span>
            <span class="institution">The Australian National University</span>
            <time>14:15 &ndash; 14:30</time>
            <p class="abstract">Deriving elemental abundances from stellar spectroscopy is a challenging yet important task applicable to many scientific interests, including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, stellar evolution, Galaxy chemical evolution and origin of the elements. This derivation requires modelling of the stellar atmospheres and spectral line formation to predict the emergent spectrum and matching it to the observed spectrum. The inferred abundances are thus model dependent, making it crucial to employ the most realistic models. Recently it has become possible to replace standard 1D LTE modelling with 3D NLTE which however are computationally very expensive; with each model taking thousands of CPU hours. We have computed the 3D NLTE synthetic spectra of lithium using ∼200 3D stellar atmosphere models (applicable to any solar type star), and their counterparts in 1D for comparison. Additionally, we provide an interpolation routine which can be used to predict lithium abundances and line profiles over different stellar parameters.</p>

            <p class="abstract">Gaia DR2 contains six-parameter astrometric solutions for 7.2 million stars. This data set informs and constrains the star formation history of our neighbourhood. Of particular interest are young, unbounded associations that still retain similar space velocities (moving groups). The discovery of moving groups and their members provide a range of useful science including well constrained ages of stars and associated exoplanets, new targets for investigating protoplanetary disks, as well as placing limitations on star formation processes. My Masters was spent developing the Chronostar software that can identify the origin point (in space and time) of stars formed in close proximity to each other. Using this tool we have the first kinematic age of the Beta Pictoris Moving Group that is consistent with chemical based ageing techniques, along with a membership list that is independent of previous literature definitions of the association.</p>
